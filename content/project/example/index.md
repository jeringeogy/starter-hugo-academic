The paper presents a new method for generating
Bessel beams with uniform axial intensity over a defined region by
using metasurfaces. Bessel beams are well known for their non-
diffracting nature, but their axial intensity varies considerably
during propagation. To address this limitation, we propose using
metasurfaces to control the amplitude and phase of the incident
fields and thereby generate a uniform axial intensity Bessel
beam. The unit cell used in this study is composed of coupled
rectangular dielectric resonators with polysilicon as the dielectric
material. Numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL
multiphysics to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
