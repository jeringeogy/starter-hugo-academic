abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces have great potential in compact optical
  systems. Most researchers use Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) based
  tools, most commonly Lumerical FDTD to calculate phase information, as well as
  model the behavior of light as it travels through the element. In this paper,
  we explore the use of a Finite Element Method (FEM) based tool that may be
  more easily available, namely COMSOL Multiphysics software. A step-by-step
  design approach is presented to help researchers wanting to use metasurfaces
  for their work. Both monochromatic and two-wavelength system designs are
  explained in detail.  In the former case, a cylindrical metasurface unit cell
  is simulated in COMSOL and the results are found to match results carried out
  using FDTD methods. Further, a spherical lens and an axicon or conical lens
  that works at two different wavelengths (1300 nm and 1550 nm) are designed.
  Their functionality is verified through simulation in COMSOL. In this design,
  coupled rectangular dielectric resonators are used as the unit cell structure.
  By implementing these specific optical functions, the use of COMSOL as a
  numerical tool in modeling dielectric metasurfaces is established.
