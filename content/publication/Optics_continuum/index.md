abstract: The main difficulty in implementing security to real-time videos is
  the processing time. Processing time is considerably high while ensuring
  security using single-core processors. This paper is analyzing the processing
  capability of Multicore CPUs and GPUs to facilitate a secure video
  transmission. Six different techniques using spatial and frequency domains are
  implemented using these systems. Adjacent frames are secured using different
  techniques to improve security. The processed video is transmitted over LAN to
  a neighboring system to see whether a real-time reproduction is possible or
  not. The paper also compares the processing time for real-time as well as
  stored videos, with varying resolutions. In the case of real-time video
  security, the GPU system was able to transmit 23 frames per second while the
  single-core CPU system was able to transmit only 2 frames per second.
  Multicore CPU system with 8 cores was able to transmit 8 frames per second.
  The resolution of the video transmitted was 320x240. When just security
  techniques were applied (video not transmitted) on a stored video of
  resolution 640x480, the performance of the GPU system was 38.3 times better
  than single-core CPU system and 7.7 times better than multicore CPU system.
