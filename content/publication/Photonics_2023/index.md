abstract: 
  The paper presents a new method for generating
  Bessel beams with uniform axial intensity over a defined region by
  using metasurfaces. Bessel beams are well known for their non-
  diffracting nature, but their axial intensity varies considerably
  during propagation. To address this limitation, we propose using
  metasurfaces to control the amplitude and phase of the incident
  fields and thereby generate a uniform axial intensity Bessel
  beam. The unit cell used in this study is composed of coupled
  rectangular dielectric resonators with polysilicon as the dielectric
  material. Numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL
  multiphysics to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
