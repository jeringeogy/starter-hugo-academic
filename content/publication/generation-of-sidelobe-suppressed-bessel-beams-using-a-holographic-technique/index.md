  We present the generation of a sidelobe suppressed
  Bessel beam using a holographic technique. In our approach, we
  used the interference pattern of a superposed Bessel beam (SBB)
  with a tilted plane wave as our hologram. The SBB is generated
  by the superposition of two Bessel beams with slightly different
  wave vectors. The parameters of these individual Bessel beams
  are optimised such that the sidelobes of the generated SBB are
  minimised. The peak intensity of the sidelobes of the generated
  SBB is about 70% less compared to a standard Bessel beam
