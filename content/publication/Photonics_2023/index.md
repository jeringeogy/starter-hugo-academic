  We present the generation of a sidelobe suppressed
  Bessel beam using a holographic technique. In our approach, we
  used the interference pattern of a superposed Bessel beam (SBB)
  with a tilted plane wave as our hologram. The SBB is generated
  by the superposition of two Bessel beams with slightly different
  wave vectors. The parameters of these individual Bessel beams
  are optimised such that the sidelobes of the generated SBB are
  minimised. The peak intensity of the sidelobes of the generated
  The paper presents a new method for generating 
  Bessel beams with uniform axial intensity over a 
  defined region by using metasurfaces. Bessel beams
  are well known for their non-diffracting nature,
  but their axial intensity varies considerably during
  propagation. To address this limitation, we propose
  using metasurfaces to control the amplitude and phase 
  of the incident fields and thereby generate a uniform
  axial intensity Bessel beam. The unit cell used in this 
  study is composed of coupled rectangular dielectric 
  resonators with polysilicon as the dielectric material. 
  Numerical simulations were conducted using COMSOL multiphysics
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
