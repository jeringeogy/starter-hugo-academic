abstract: The need for a higher data rate in the modern communication world
  leads to the development of multicarrier modulation. OFDM, the most popular
  MCM technique, has some disadvantages like inefficiency due to the insertion
  of cyclic prefix, spectral leakage among the subchannels due to the poor
  stopband attenuation of prototype filter, etc. Due to these drawbacks of OFDM,
  a Filter Bank-based Multi-Carrier system with Offset Quadrature Amplitude
  Modulation has been proposed. The analysis and synthesis of filter banks in
  FBMC- OQAM system are designed using exponential modulation of a single
  prototype filter which is designed using the frequency sampling method of
  filter design. In the presence of fading channels, Frequency Domain MMSE
  one-tap equalizer is designed. Simulation results for Vehicular A and
  Pedestrian B channels show that the proposed equalizer gives better results
  for BER performance for the system.
